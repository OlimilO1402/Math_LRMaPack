This project is a port of LAPack to VBC. LAPack is a Linear Algebra package, which contains many matrix related calculation functions and classes.
The program is a console app, no window. In the resources folder you will also find the original C#-code from Lutz RÃ¶der, as well as the corresponding VB.net-code. 
Project started around sept.2006.
